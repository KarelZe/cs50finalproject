intro
=====
The 100k calculator is a nifty tool, that helps you estimate your future portfolio value based on historical values.
Just input ticker symbols, confidence and your horizon and we'll do the heavy lifting for you. A wait there's more...
You will be returned a correlated portfolio value based on 10 years of stock market data. For beauty reasons the chart
uses linear interpolation. Past returns do not guarantee future performance. Amen.
